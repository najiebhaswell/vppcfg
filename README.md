# A VPP Configuration Utility

This tool reads a configuration file, checks it for syntax and semantic correctness, and then
reconciles a running [VPP](https://fd.io/) daemon with its configuration. It is meant to be
re-entrant and stateless. The tool connects to the VPP API and creates/removes all of the
configuration in a minimally intrusive way.

***NOTE*** This code is under development, and probably won't work well until this note is removed.

## Building

This program expects Python3 and PIP to be installed. It's known to work on Debian Bookworm ARM64.

```
## Install python build dependencies 
$ make install-deps

## Ensure all unittests pass.
$ make test

## Build vppcfg
$ make build

## Install the tool with PIP
$ make install

## To build & install debian packaging
$ make pkg-deb
$ ls -l ../vppcfg_*_amd64.deb
```

## Running

```
usage: vppcfg [-h] [-d] [-q] [-f] {check,dump,plan,apply} ...

positional arguments:
  {check,dump,plan,apply}
    check               check given YAML config for validity (no VPP)
    dump                dump current running VPP configuration (VPP readonly)
    plan                plan changes from current VPP dataplane to target config (VPP readonly)
    apply               apply changes from current VPP dataplane to target config

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           enable debug logging, default False
  -q, --quiet           be quiet (only warnings/errors), default False
  -f, --force           force progress despite warnings, default False

Please see vppcfg <command> -h   for per-command arguments
